# Rockbuster_SQL
A movie rental business called Rockbuster once had locations all over the world. The Rockbuster Stealth management team intends to develop an online video rental service using its current movie licenses in order to stay competitive as they compete with streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime.

#Objective

The plan for the launch of the new online service will be aided by our partnership with the Rockbusters Business Intelligence team. A relational database holding information about the present clients makes up the dataset offered.

#Data

The data was provided by Rockbuster in the Project Brief. The data set worked on contained the following information:
